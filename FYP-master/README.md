I created this for my Final Year Project in Games Design and Development at LIT. The aim of the project was designing and developing a tool in Unity that would allow developers of platforming games to deploy an AI agent that would move through and complete a level that they have created. The tool used a Pathfinding algorithm that utilized A* Search and Behaviour Trees to find the optimal path through a level. The project researched and experimented with several different algorithms as the tool was designed to be as universal as possible and work with a wide range of environments within the platforming genre.
